                  <p>― I'm the most successful person ever to run for the presidency, by far. Nobody's ever been more
                    successful than me. I'm the most successful person ever to run. Ross Perot isn't successful like me.
                    Romney ― I have a Gucci store that's worth more than Romney. Sorry losers and haters, but my IQ is
                    one of the highest ― and you all know it! Please don't feel so stupid or insecure, it's not your

                      <p>Started Trump University with Michael Sexton and Jonathan Spitalny: no grades, certificates and
                        other bureaucracy, but program offered courses in real estate, asset management
                        entrepreneurship,
                        and wealth creation. 98% students gave positive reviews while studying, however some of these
                        ungrateful gringos filed lawsuits against Trump University after the course. I had to pay $25
                        million to settle that...</p>

                      <p>Began a multi-building development along the Hudson River, which was named Trump Place. Me and
                        the other investors sold our shares for $1.8 billion and that was then the biggest residential

                        building and boosted it from three-star to four-star hotel (I called it "the Mona Lisa" and sold
                        it for a lot of cash in 1995)</p>

                      <p>I bought the Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach and turned it into a private club.You can join if
                        you pay $200K initiation fee (and there is another annual fee for members, it is very expensive
                        to be rich). That year I also opened a casino called Trump Castle. My wife Ivana became a
                        manager, because she is another Trump!</p>

                      <p>I purchased New Jersey Generals, an American football team. I changed team's play schedule and
                        filed an antitrust lawsuit against United States Football League, so NJG are not doing so good
                        now, but back then they were great!</p>
                    <li>
                      <p><small>1980</small></p>
                      <p>Started developing the Trump Tower skyscraper in Manhattan, I payed a crew of undocumented
                        Polish workers to demolish the historic Bonwit Teller store, including art deco features. All
                        this to make architectural critic Paul Goldberger say in 1983 that the tower's atrium is "the
                        most pleasant interior public space to be completed in New York in some years". At the same time
